<h3>OpenACS 4.2 Alpha</h3>
This is an alpha release of OpenACS 4.2.   This release has been subjected to an organized test
effort, but please bear in mind that we are still in the process of developing testing tools,
methodology, and scripts.
<p>Please report bugs using our
<a href="http://openacs.org/sdm">Software Development Manager</a> at the
<a href="http://openacs.org/">OpenACS website</a>.
<h4>Note on installing package</h4>
The APM will die if you attempt to install more than a few
packages at once in the Oracle version.  This is due to the list of required
files being stored in a varchar which is limited in Oracle to being 4,000 bytes long.
<h4>Testing Notes</h4>
Here are some notes from our testing group.  While not quite up to date it should
give you some ideas of where things stand.
