<h3>What we tell other users about you</h3>

In general we identify content that you've posted by your full name.
In an attempt to protect you from unsolicited bulk email (spam), we
keep your email address hidden except from other registered users.
Total privacy is technically feasible but an important element of an
online community is that people can learn from each other.  So we try
to make it possible for users with common interests to contact each
other.
