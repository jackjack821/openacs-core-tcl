acs-lang package version 4.0

Changes from the previous version

+ The timezones code now uses the acs-references package timezones database

+ There is default code to store and cache the user's locale
preference, using session variables

+ The message catalog works on a per-package basis, so each package
can defines its own /catalog directory. By default, the catalog under
/packages/acs-lang will get loaded at server startup. Other packages
should explicitly call 

  lang_catalog_load <package-key>

in their init.tcl file.

Messages keys which are loaded are automatically prefixed with the
package key.


+ The lang_message_lookup function takes an optional default value
