This is an alpha release of OpenACS 4.2.   This release has been subjected to an organized test
effort, but please bear in mind that we are still in the process of developing testing tools,
methodology, and scripts.
<p>Please report bugs using our
<a href="http://openacs.org/sdm/one-package.tcl?package_id=9">
Software Development Manager</a> at the
<a href="http://openacs.org/">OpenACS website</a>.  
The latest information on installating this alpha release under Oracle 8.1.6/7 or
PostgreSQL 7.1.* can be found there as well.   Currently the toolkit will not 
install under Oracle 9i due to Oracle having made "delete" an illegal name for
PL/SQL procedures and functions.
<p>You may want to begin by reading Ars Digita's original documentation
on installing under <a href="unix-install.html">Unix/Linux</a> or
<a href="win-install.html">Windows</a>.  The basic process is unchanged, and we
expect to update the documentation for our beta release.
<p>After installation, the full documentation set for acs-core provided in the original
aD release can be found by visiting
http://[your-host]/doc.
<h4>Note on installing packages</h4>
The APM will die if you attempt to install more than a few
packages at once in the Oracle version.  This is due to the list of required
files being stored in a varchar which is limited in Oracle to being 4,000 bytes long.
<h4>Testing Notes</h4>
Here are some notes from our testing group.  While not quite up to date it should
give you some ideas of where things stand.
