	    OpenACS (Open Architecture Community System) is an
	    advanced toolkit for building scalable, community-oriented
	    web applications.  If you're thinking of building an
	    enterprise-level web application, OpenACS is a solid,
	    proven foundation that will give you a 3-6 month
	    headstart.
	  </p><p>
	    OpenACS is also a collection of pre-built applications and
	    services that you can use to build your web
	    site/application. Through a modular architecture, OpenACS
	    has packages for user/groups management, content
	    management, e-commerce, news, FAQ, calendar, forums, bug
	    tracking, full-text searching, and <a href="http://dev.openacs.org/packages/package-list" target="_top">much
	    more</a>.
	  </p><p>
	    OpenACS relies on <a href="http://www.aolserver.com/" target="_top">AOLserver</a>, the
	    free, multithreaded, scalable, Tcl-enabled,
	    web/application server used by America On-Line for most of
	    its web sites, and a true acid-compliant Relational
	    Database Management System (RDBMS). Currently OpenACS
	    supports PostgreSQL, an open source RDBMS, and
	    Oracle. (<a href="http://openacs.org/about/what-is-openacs" target="_top">read
	    more</a>)
	  </p><p>
	    The OpenACS toolkit is based on the ArsDigita Community
	    System. ArsDigita (now part of Red Hat, Inc.) kindly made
	    their work available under the <a href="http://dev.openacs.org/about/licensing/" target="_top">GPL</a>,
	    making all of this possible. 
	  </p><p>
	  &#8220;<span class="quote">The ArsDigita Community System (ACS) is a toolkit of software
	  that will help you build Web services with a collaborative dimension,
	  ranging from knowledge management within companies to B2C ecommerce
	  to product support and community among the customers. The software is
	  free and open-source and has been tested in heavy use since
	  1995.</span>&#8221; - Philip Greenspun
	</p><p>
	  OpenACS was born when Don Baccus, Ben Adida, et al decided
	  to port ACS from Oracle to PostgreSQL, thus making it a
	  fully open-source solution.
	</p><p>
	  OpenACS 5.0.0a4 is the next generation of the web toolkit. It's based on
	  ACS 4, but no longer follows ArsDigita development. Unlike ACS
	  (which required Oracle) and OpenACS 3.x (which required PostgreSQL),
	  OpenACS 5.0.0a4 allows you to use either database. It's also built in such
	  a way to allow enterprising hackers (in the good sense of
	  the word) to extend it to other databases. Don Baccus leads
	  the development and numerous developers and non-developers
	  contribute from around the world.
