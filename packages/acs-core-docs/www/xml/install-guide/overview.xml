	<title>What is OpenACS?</title>
	<para>
	  According to Philip Greenspun:
	</para>

	<para>
	  <quote>The ArsDigita Community System (ACS) is a toolkit of software
	  that will help you build Web services with a collaborative dimension,
	  ranging from knowledge management within companies to B2C ecommerce
	  to product support and community among the customers. The software is
	  free and open-source and has been tested in heavy use since
	  1995.</quote>
	</para>

	<para>
	  What's OpenACS? OpenACS was born when Don Baccus, Ben Adida,
	  et al decided to port ACS from Oracle to PostgreSQL, thus making it a fully open-source solution.</para>

	<para>
	  OpenACS &version; is the next generation of the web toolkit. It's based on
	  ACS 4, but no longer follows ArsDigita development. Unlike both ACS
	  (which required Oracle) and OpenACS 3.x (which required PostgreSQL),
	  OpenACS &version; allows you to use either database. It's also built in such
	  a way to allow enterprising hackers (in the good sense of
	  the word) to extend it to other databases. Don Baccus leads
	  the development and numerous developers (and non-developers)
	  contribute from around the world.

	<title>Requirements</title>
	<para>
	  You will need a PC (or equivalent) with at least these minimum
	  requirements:
	</para>
	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem><para>Pentium processor</para></listitem>
	  <listitem><para>128 MB RAM

	<para>
	  If you want to serve pages to people outside of your machine, you'll
	  need a network connection of some type.
	</para>
	
	<para>
	  Note that these are minimum requirements to get a development system
	  up and running. For a large production system, we recommend you read about
	  the (now slightly obsolete) <ulink

	  Server Architecture</ulink> article.

	  Running a reliable database-backed web server requires experience
	  with the server's environment, in this case UNIX.  UNIX is not always
	  an intuitive environment and this guide cannot hope to explain every
	  nuance.  If you follow the reference implementation, all of
	  the unix commands you need will be in the text.  However,
	  you will have trouble indentifying typos or other problems.
	  Ideally, you should be comfortable with the following tasks before
	  attempting an installation:
	</para>

	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem><para> 
		  Adding users, groups, setting passwords  
		</para></listitem>

	  <listitem><para> 		  
		  (For Oracle) Starting an X server and running an X program remotely
	  </para></listitem> 

	  <listitem><para> 
		  Basic file management using <computeroutput>cp, rm,
			mv,</computeroutput> and <computeroutput>cd</computeroutput>
		</para></listitem> 

	  <listitem><para> 
		  Compiling a program using ./config and make.
		</para></listitem>
	</itemizedlist>

	<para>
	  If you've never done these things before, consider exploring UNIX in
	  greater depth before installing OpenACS.  Some useful resources for
	  doing this are described in the <xref linkend="install-resources"/>
	  section.
	</para>

	<para>
	  All of the software that you will need is free and open-source,
	  except for Oracle. You can obtain a free copy of Oracle for
	  development purposes. This is described in the <xref
	  linkend="install-oracle-getit"/> section.

		  Keep track of the commands you are run and record their output. I
		  like to do my installations in a shell inside of emacs

		  We'll point out where the error logs for the various pieces of

      After reading through this tome, you may ask yourself if there is a
      better way. Well, not quite. Jonathan Marsden has created RPMs (at
      <ulink
      url="http://www.xc.org/jonathan/openacs/openacs4-rpm-based-install.html">http://www.xc.org</ulink>)
      for OpenACS 4.5 but there are not yet any for version
      &version;. There has been talk about automating the install process,
      but that hasn't happened yet. Stay tuned!
