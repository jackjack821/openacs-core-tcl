      <para>
        Should it become necessary to rebuild a tablespace from scratch,
        you can use the <computeroutput>drop user</computeroutput> command
        in SVRMGRL with the <computeroutput>cascade</computeroutput>
        option. This command will drop the user and every database object
        the user owns.</para>

      <programlisting>
SVRMGR&gt; drop user <emphasis>service0</emphasis> cascade;</programlisting>

      <para>
        If this does not work because svrmgrl &quot;cannot drop a user that
        is currently connected&quot;, make sure to kill the AOLserver using
        this user. If it still does not work, do:</para>

      <programlisting>
SVRMGR&gt; select username, sid, serial# from v$session where lower(username)=&#39;<emphasis>service0</emphasis>&#39;;</programlisting>

      <para>and then</para>
      <programlisting>
SVRMGR&gt; alter system kill session &#39;<emphasis>sid</emphasis>,<emphasis>serial#</emphasis>&#39;;</programlisting>

      <para>
        where <emphasis>sid</emphasis> and <emphasis>serial#</emphasis> are
        replaced with the corresponding values for the open session.</para>

      <para><emphasis role="strong">Use with caution!</emphasis></para>

      <para>
        If you feel the need to delete <emphasis>everything</emphasis>
        related to the service, you can also issue the following:</para>
      <programlisting>
SVRMGR&gt; drop tablespace <emphasis>service0</emphasis> including contents cascade constraints;</programlisting>

      <para>
        Dropping a PostgreSQL tablespace is easy. You have to stop any
        AOLserver instances that are using the database that you wish to
        drop. If you're using daemontools, this is simple, just use the
        'down' flag (-d). If you're using inittab, you have to comment out
        your server in <computeroutput>/etc/inittab</computeroutput>,
        reread the inittab with <computeroutput>/sbin/init
        q</computeroutput>, and then <computeroutput>restart-aolserver
        <emphasis>service0</emphasis></computeroutput>.</para>
    
      <para>Then, to drop the db, just do:</para>
      <programlisting>
service0:~$ dropdb <emphasis>service0</emphasis>
DROP DATABASE</programlisting>

  <sect2 id="install-next-nightly-vacuum">
    <title>Vacuum Postgres nightly</title>
    <para>
      The "vacuum" command must be run periodically to reclaim space. The
      "vacuum analyze" form additionally collects statistics on the
      disbursion of columns in the database, which the optimizer uses when
      it calculates just how to execute queries. The availability of this
      data can make a tremendous difference in the execution speed of
      queries. This command can also be run from cron, but it probably makes
      more sense to run this command as part of your nightly backup
      procedure - if "vacuum" is going to screw up the database, you'd
      prefer it to happen immediately after (not before!) you've made a
      backup! The "vacuum" command is very reliable, but conservatism is
      the key to good system management. So, if you're using the export
      procedure described above, you don't need to do this extra step.
    </para>

    <para>Edit your crontab:</para>
    <programlisting>
joeuser:~$ crontab -e</programlisting>

    <para>We'll set vacuum up to run nightly at 1 AM. Add the following
    line:</para>
    <programlisting>
0 1 * * * /usr/local/pgsql/bin/vacuumdb birdnotes</programlisting>
