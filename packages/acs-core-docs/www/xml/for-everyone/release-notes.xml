      <listitem>
        <para>
          Internationalization support. 

          A message catalog to store translated text, localization of
          dates, number formatting, timezone conversion, etc. Allows
          you to serve your users in their language.
        </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>
          External authenticaiton.

          Integrate with outside user databases through e.g. LDAP, RADIUS, Kerberos, MS Active Directory. 
          Imports user information through IMS Enterprise 1.1 format. Easily extended to support other 
          authentication, password management, account creation, and account import mechanisms.

          This includes improvements to the basic cookie handling, so logins can be expired without the 
          user's identity being completely lost. You can set login to expire after a certain period 
          (e.g. 8 hours, then password must be refreshed), or you can have all issues login cookies
          expired at once, e.g. if you have left a permanent login cookie on a public machine somewhere.

      <listitem>
        <para>
          User interface enhancements.

          All pages, including site-wide and subsite admin pages, will be
          templated, so they can be styled using master template and
          site-wide stylesheets.

          We have a new default-master template, which includes links to
          administration, your workspace, and login/logout, and is rendered
          using CSS.

          And there's a new community template
          (/packages/acs-subsite/www/group-master), which provides useful
          navigation to the applications and administrative UI in a
          subsite.

          In addition, there's new, simpler UI for managing members of a
          subsite, instantiating and mounting applications, setting
          permissions, parameters, etc.

          Site-wide admin as also seen the addition of a new simpler
          software install UI to replace the APM for non-developer users,
          and improved access to parameters, internationalization,
          automated testing, service contracts, etc.

          The list builder has been added for easily generating templated
          tables and lists, with features such as filtering, sorting,
          actions on multiple rows with checkboxes, etc. Most of all, it's
          fast to use, and results in consistently-looking,
          consistently-behaving, templated tables.
        </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>
          Automated testing.

          The automated testing framework has been improved significantly,
          and there are automated tests for a number of packages.
        </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>
          Security enhancements. 
  
          HTML quoting now happens in the templating system, greatly
          minimizing the chance that users can sneak malicious HTML
          into the pages of other users.
