  <para>
	This is a beta release of OpenACS &version;.  This release has been subjected
	to an organized test effort, but please bear in mind that we are still
	in the process of developing testing tools, methodology, and scripts.
  </para>

  <para>
	Please report bugs using our
	<ulink url="http://openacs.org/sdm/one-package.tcl&amp;package_id=9">
	  Software Development Manager</ulink> at the <ulink
	  url="http://openacs.org/">OpenACS website</ulink>.  The latest
	information on installing this alpha release under Oracle 8.1.6/7
	or PostgreSQL 7.1.* can be found there as well.  Currently the
	toolkit will not install under Oracle 9i due to Oracle having made
	"delete" an illegal name for PL/SQL procedures and functions.
  </para>

  <para>
	You may want to begin by reading our installation documentation for
	<xref linkend="unix-install"/> or <xref linkend="win-install"/>.  Note
	that the Windows documentation is not current for OpenACS &version;,
	but an alternative is to use John Sequeira's <ulink
	url="http://www.pobox.com/~johnseq/projects/oasisvm/">Oasis VM
	project</ulink>.
  </para>

  <para>
	After installation, the full documentation set can be found by visiting
	http://[your-host]/doc. Not all pieces are updated for OpenACS &version; at
	this moment.
  </para>

	<title>Site Wide Searching</title>

	<para>
	  If you're using Oracle 8.1.6 or 8.1.7 Enterprise Edition you may want
	  to uncomment the SQL that causes InterMedia to keep online searching
	  online while indexing.  The feature doesn't exist in Standard Edition
	  and OpenACS &version; now defaults to being loadable in SE.  Just grep for
	  'sync' to find the code.  
	</para>

	<para>
	  Also be sure to read the documentation in the Site Wide Search
	  package's sql/oracle directory.  The APM doesn't execute the SQL for
	  this package, in part due to the fact that some steps need to be run
	  as the Oracle user 'ctxsys'.
	</para>

	<para>
	  If you're using PostgreSQL be sure to read the documentation on
	  installing the Open FTS driver for OpenACS.  It's included in the
	  package as a text file and is also summarized at the end of the
	  installation documentation in the section, <xref
	  linkend="install-next-openfts"/>.  As with the Oracle version, there
	  are steps you must take manually in order to get this feature
	  working.

	  date it should give you some ideas of where things stand.
