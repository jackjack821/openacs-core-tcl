      This document is a guide on how to write a software package for
      OpenACS. OpenACS packages are installed and maintained
      with the OpenACS Package Manager (APM).  This document presents reasons
      for packaging software, conventions for the file system and naming
      that must be followed, and step by step instructions for creating a
      new package for the "Notes" example package.

    <title>Why package your software?</title>

    <para>
      To answer this question, we should examine how OpenACS servers were
      organized in the past. We will assume throughout this document that
      the page root for your server is called <computeroutput>ROOT</computeroutput>.  In OpenACS
      3.2.x and earlier, a typical server might have a file system behind it
      that looked something like this:
    </para>

    </programlisting>

    <para>
      In previous versions of OpenACS, you wrote a new application like this:
    </para>

    <orderedlist>
      <listitem><para>Put all Tcl library procedures under
      <computeroutput>server-root/tcl</computeroutput>.</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>Put all User viewable content under
      <computeroutput>server-root/www</computeroutput>.</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>Put all Admin content under <computeroutput>/admin/package-key/</computeroutput>.
    </para></listitem>
    </orderedlist>

    <para>
      This structure is very simple, and worked well in a world where
      OpenACS was basically a single monolithic entity. But, this organization
      made it difficult to distribute modules as independent packages, because
      the pieces of each module are strewn all over the tree in at least 3
      or 4 different areas. 
    </para>

    <para>
      Here is how an OpenACS &version; server is laid out:

    <para>
      Note that a major reorganization has happened here. The diagram only
      expands the structure of the <computeroutput>bboard/</computeroutput> package directory,
      but all the others are basically the same. Each package encapsulates
      all of its data model, library code, logic, adminstration pages and
      user pages in a single part of the file tree. This organization has
      two major advantages:
    </para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem><para> 
          This structure makes it easy for developers to track
          down <emphasis>everything</emphasis> that is related to a
          particular package without hunting all over the file system.
        </para></listitem> 

      <listitem><para> 
          Encapsulating everything
          about a package in one place also makes it much easier to
          distribute packages independently from the OpenACS itself.
        </para></listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>
      In order to make this work, we need a system that keeps track of the
      packages that have been installed in the server, where those packages
      have been installed, and a standard way to map URLs that a client
      sends to our server to the right page in the appropriate
      package. While we're at it, this tool should also automate
      package installation, dependency checking, upgrades, and package
      removal. In OpenACS &version;, this tool is called the APM.
    </para>


  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="packages-apm">
    <title>The APM</title>


    <para>
      The APM is used to create, maintain, and install packages.  It takes
      care of copying all of the files and registering the package in the
      system.  The APM is responsible for:
    </para>

    <orderedlist>
      <listitem><para>Package registration</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>Automatic installation of packages: loading data models, code
      libraries, and so on.</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>Checking what packages depend on what other packages.</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para>Storing information on the package including ownership and a file
      list.</para></listitem>
    </orderedlist>

    <para>
      In addition for packages that are applications, the APM is responsible
      for keeping track of where in the site a user must go in order to use
      the application. To do this, the APM defines a set of objects that we
      call <emphasis>package instances</emphasis>. Once a package is loaded, the
      administrator can create as many instances of the package as she
      likes, and map these instances to any URL in the site that she
      wants. If packages are analogous to executable programs in an
      operating system, then package instances are analgous to multiple
      running copies of a single program. Each instance can be independently
      administered and each instance maintains its own set of application
      parameters and options.
    </para>

    <para>
      The following sections will show you how to make a package for the
      Notes application. In addition, they will discuss some new site
      management features in OpenACS &version; that take advantage of the APM's package
      instance model. The two most important of these are <emphasis>subsites</emphasis>,
      and the <emphasis>site map</emphasis> tool, which can be used to map applications to
      one or more arbitrary URLs in a running site.
    </para>

    <para>
      We will also discuss how to organize your files and queries so
      they work with the OpenACS Query Dispatcher.

    </para></listitem>


      <listitem><para>Fill out the form for adding a new package. The form explains what
      everything means, but we'll repeat the important bits here for easy

          <term>Package Key
          </term>
          
          <listitem><para>
          This is a short text string that should uniquely name your package to
          distinguish it from all the others. It is used as a database key to
          keep track of the package and as the name of the directory in the file
          system where all the files related to your package will live. Example
          package keys in the current system include: <computeroutput>bboard</computeroutput>,
          <computeroutput>acs-kernel</computeroutput> and so on. For the example application, we
          will use the package key <computeroutput>notes</computeroutput>.
        </para></listitem>
        </varlistentry>
        <varlistentry>
          <term>Package Name
          </term>
          
          <listitem><para>
          This is a short human readable name for your package. For our example,
          we will use the name "Notes".
        </para></listitem>
        </varlistentry>
        <varlistentry>
          <term>Package Plural
          </term>
          
          <listitem><para>
          If your package name is a nice singular noun, this should be the
          plural form of it. I assume the plural form is used when multiple
          instances of the package are used by a single service. We'll talk more
          about package instances later. Our example apllication doesn't really
          have a good plural name. So just make it also be "Notes".

          <term>Package Type
          </term>
          
          <listitem><para>
          Generally we think of packages as either being <emphasis>applications</emphasis>,
          meaning that the package is meant primarily for use by end-users, or
          <emphasis>services</emphasis> meaning that the package is meant to be a reusable
          library of code, to be used by other packages. <computeroutput>bboard</computeroutput> is
          a good example of an application, while <computeroutput>acs-templating</computeroutput> is
          a good example of a service. Our example is an application, so pick
          that.

          Enter a short summary and longer description of what the Notes

      <listitem><para>
          The directory that APM created will be empty except for the
          <computeroutput>notes.info</computeroutput> file. Create a file
          called
          <computeroutput>ROOT/packages/notes/sql/oracle/notes-create.sql</computeroutput>. We'll
          fill this file with our <link linkend="objects">data model</link>
          very soon. Create a file called
          <computeroutput>ROOT/packages/notes/sql/oracle/notes-drop.sql</computeroutput>. This
          will contain the instructions to drop the data model. To be
          complete, you would also create the PostgreSQL versions of these
          files as well in
          <computeroutput>ROOT/packages/notes/sql/postgresql/notes-create.sql</computeroutput>
          and
          <computeroutput>ROOT/packages/notes/sql/postgresql/notes-drop.sql</computeroutput>.
        </para>

        <para>
          After you do this, go back to the main APM page. From there,
          click the link called &quot;notes&quot; to go to the management
          page for the new package. Now click the link called &quot;Manage
          file information&quot;, then the &quot;Scan the
          <computeroutput>packages/notes</computeroutput> directory for
          additional files in this package&quot; link on that page to scan
          the file system for new files.  This will bring you do a page
          that lists all the files you just added and lets you add them to
          the <computeroutput>notes</computeroutput> package.
        </para>

        <para>
          Note that while the <computeroutput>.sql</computeroutput> files
          have been added to the packge, they <emphasis>have not</emphasis>
          been loaded into the database. For the purposes of development,
          you have to load the data model by hand, because while OpenACS
          has automatic mechanisms for loading and reloading
          <computeroutput>.tcl</computeroutput> files for code, it does not
          do the same thing for data model files.  
        </para></listitem>

      <listitem><para>Now go back to the main management page for the <computeroutput>notes</computeroutput>
      If your package has parameters, create them using the &quot;Manage
        Parameter Information&quot; link.</para></listitem>
      
      <listitem><para>The new package has been created and installed in the server. At
      this point, you should add your package files to your CVS repository.
      I'll assume that you have set up your development repository according
      to the standards described in 
      <ulink url="http://acs40.arsdigita.com/acs40-project-central/client-build.html">these instructions</ulink>. If so, then you just do this:
    </para>
    

    <programlisting>

% cd ROOT/packages
% cvs add notes
% cd notes
% cvs add notes.info
% cvs add sql
% cd sql
% cvs add *.sql
% cd ROOT/packages/notes
% cvs commit -m "add new package for notes"

    </programlisting>

      </listitem>


      <listitem><para>
      Now you can start developing the package. In addition to writing code,
      you should also consider the tasks outlined in the <ulink url="http://acs40.arsdigita.com/acs40-project-central/package-submission.html">package submission guidelines</ulink>.
    </para></listitem>

    </orderedlist>


  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="packages-subsites">
    <title>The Site Map and Package Instances</title>


    <para>
      At this point, you are probably excited to see your new package in
      action. But, we haven't added any user visible pages yet. By
      convention, user visible pages go in the
      <computeroutput>ROOT/packages/notes/www</computeroutput> directory. So go there and add a
      file called <computeroutput>hello.html</computeroutput> with some text in it. Now we have
      to make the user pages visible in the site. Since we didn't put the
      pages underneath <computeroutput>ROOT/www</computeroutput> they will not appear on their
      own.  What we have to do is <emphasis>mount</emphasis> the application into the site
      map. That is, we have to define the URL from which the application
      will serve its pages. This process is slightly more complex than in
      OpenACS 3.x, but also much more flexible.
    </para>

    <para>
      In OpenACS 3.x, everything in the site was implicitly mounted underneath
      <computeroutput>ROOT/www</computeroutput>. AOLserver automatically took any URL like
      <computeroutput>/foo/bar/moo/baz.html</computeroutput> and mapped it to the file
      <computeroutput>ROOT/www/foo/bar/moo/baz.html</computeroutput>.  This was conveniently
      simple, but lacked flexibility.  In particular, it was difficult to
      map content that lived outside the page root into the site, and it was
      also hard to map mulitiple URLs to the same place in the file system.
    </para>

    <para>
      In OpenACS &version;, administrators can define an arbitrary mapping between the
      URLs the user types and the actual file in the file system that is
      served. This mapping is called the <emphasis>site map</emphasis> and entries in the
      site map are called <emphasis>site nodes</emphasis>. Each site node maps a URL to an
      OpenACS object. Since package instances are objects, the site map allows
      us to easily map package instances to URLs. As we said before, each
      instance of an application has its own set of parameters and
      runs from its own URL within the site.  What this means is that even
      though all the code for the <computeroutput>notes</computeroutput> application lives in
      <computeroutput>ROOT/packages/notes</computeroutput>, the application itself can run from
      any number of locations in the site. This allows developers and
      administrators to build sites that look to the user like a collection
      of many indedendent applications that actually run on a single shared
      code base. The <link linkend="request-processor">request-processor</link> document shows
      you how OpenACS figures out which instance of your application was
      requested by the user at any given time. The <link linkend="subsites">page development</link> tutorial shows you how to use this
      information in your user interface.
    </para>

    <para>
      In order to make the new <computeroutput>notes</computeroutput> application visible to
      users, we have to mount it in the site map. You do this by going to
      the <ulink url="/admin/site-map">Site Map</ulink> page, which is by
      default available at <computeroutput>/acs-admin/site-map</computeroutput>. Use the
      interface here to add a new sub-folder called <computeroutput>notes</computeroutput> to
      the root of the site, then click &quot;new application&quot; to mount a new
      instance of the <computeroutput>notes</computeroutput> application to the site. Name the
      new instance <computeroutput>notes-1</computeroutput>.
    </para>

    <para>
      Then type this URL into your browser:

    </para> 

    <programlisting>

http://your-server.your-domain.com/notes/hello.html

    </programlisting>


    <para>
      Now you should see the contents of the page that you added. What has
      happened is that all URLs that start with <computeroutput>/notes</computeroutput> have
      been mapped in such a way as to serve content from the directory
      <computeroutput>ROOT/packages/notes/www</computeroutput>. At this point, you can
      experiment with the site map by mounting multiple instances of the not
      yet written Notes application at various places in the site. In a
      later document, we'll see how to write your application so that the
      code can detect from what URL it was invoked. This is the key
      to supporting <link linkend="subsites">subsites</link>.
