It seems to me that a lot of
people have been asking for some guidelines on how to write automated
tests. I've done several tests by now and have found the process to be
extremely easy and useful. It's a joy to work with automated testing
once you get the hang of it.</p><p>I just wrote a test script for the acs-service-contract package and
thought I'd might as well post a step-by-step run-through, since some
people have been asking for this. Here goes.
</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Create the directory that will contain the test
        script(s):</p><pre class="screen">
$ cd /web/simon/packages/acs-service-contract/tcl
$ mkdir test
</pre></li><li><p>Create the .tcl library that holds the test
        procs:</p><pre class="screen">
$ cd test
$ emacs acs-service-contract-procs.tcl
</pre></li><li><p>Write the tests.  This is obviously the big step
        :)</p><p>
The script should first call ad_library like any normal -procs.tcl file:
</p><pre class="screen">ad_library {
    ...
}
</pre><p>To create a test case you call
<tt class="computeroutput">aa_register_case test_case_name.</tt>. 
Once you've created the test case you start writing the needed logic.
Let's say you just wrote an API for adding and deleting notes in the
notes packages and wanted to test that. You'd probably want to write a
test that first creates a note, then verifies that it was inserted,
then perhaps deletes it again, and finally verifies that it is
gone.</p><p>
Naturally this means you'll be adding a lot of bogus data to the
database, which you're not really interested in having there. To avoid
this I usually do two things. I always put all my test code inside a
call to aa_run_with_teardown which basically means that all the
inserts, deletes, and updates will be rolled back once the test has
been executed. A very useful feature. Instead of inserting bogus data
like:        <tt class="computeroutput">set name "Simon"</tt>, I tend to generate a random script in order avoid inserting a value that's already in the database:
</p><pre class="screen">set name [ad_generate_random_string]
</pre><p>
<i class="parameter"><tt>Here's how the test case looks so far:</tt></i>

</p><pre class="screen">aa_register_case acs_sc_impl_new_from_spec {

   aa_run_with_teardown \
       -rollback \
       -testcode  {
          ... logic ...
       }
}
</pre><p>Now let's look at the actual test code. That's the code that
goes inside <tt class="computeroutput">-testcode {}</tt>.
In my case I had added a new column to acs_sc_impls (pretty_name),
which meant that I had to change the datamodel and the Tcl API to
support this new change. To make sure I didn't screw up, I wrote a test
that created a new service contract, then a new implementation of that
contract, and called acs_sc::impl::get to check that the data in the
new column had been added correctly and then finally verified that the
pretty_name was actually what I had tried to insert. It looked
something like this:
</p><pre class="screen">set spec {
     name "foo_contract"
     description "Blah blah"
     ...
}

# Create service contract
acs_sc::contract::new_from_spec -spec $spec

set spec {
     name "foo_impl"
     description "Blah blah blah"
     pretty_name "Foo Implementation"
     ...
}

# Create implementation
set impl_id [acs_sc::impl::new_from_spec -spec $spec]

# Get the values of the implementation we just created
acs_sc::impl::get -impl_id $impl_id -array impl

#Verify that the pretty_name column has the correct value
aa_equals "did column pretty_name get set correctly?" $impl(pretty_name) "Foo Implementation"
</pre><p>Now you might not know how acs-service-contract works, but that
doesn't matter. I'm basically inserting data into the database, then
querying for the database to check that it got inserted and then
finally, using aa_equals, I compare the result with what I inserted to
verify that everything is correct.</p><p>
There are number of other useful procs for determening whether a test case was successful or not, namely:
</p><pre class="screen">aa_true "is this true?" [expr ![empty_string $foo]]
aa_false "is this true?" [empty_string $foo]
</pre><p>There a number of other useful procs and I will encourage you to
look at the few packages for which tests have already been implemented.
That is perhaps the best documentation we have so far.
