  5.x</title> </head> <h1>TSEARCH2 PostgreSQL FtsEngineDriver for
  OpenACS 5.x</h1> <h2>Installing</h2> You'll need PostgreSQL 7.3 or
  newer. The tsearch2 from contrib needs to be compiled. In addition
  tsearch2.sql needs to be loaded into your database. In addition be
  sure to mount the Search package somewhere. The indexer will not run
  is Search is not mounted.  The FtsEngineDriver parameter of the
  search package must be changes to "tsearch2-driver".

  <h2>Using</h2>
  If you install tsearch2-driver and mount search, go ahead and add
  some content. Weblogger or edit-this-page will generate indexed
  cotent. I had to manually load lars-blogger-sc-create.sql to get
  Weblogger to register the service contract implementation to index
  the content. After that it worked fine.
  
  <h2>Features</h2>
  This version includes only the most basic features to prove that
  tsearch2 can be used for indexing. There are many configuration
  options that will be avaialble as parameters in the future. It is
  also clear that the current service contract definitions are not
  flexible enough to work well with every possible search driver, so
  some features may not be available until after the search package is
  also updated.
