# Wrapper for aspell/ispell that sets the HOME environment variable.
# Can't seem to do this from AOLserver Tcl.
# Takes three arguments: file to spellcheck, dictionary file, language.
#
# Root must be able to execute this file if AOLserver runs as root
# (which it does if it runs on a privileged port, e.g., port 80)

#HOME=/usr/local/aolserver
HOME=$4
export HOME
