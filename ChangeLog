	* packages/acs-mail-lite/tcl/acs-mail-lite-procs.tcl: Envelope
	  sender disappeared during the refactoring of send between 5.3 and
	  5.4 and therefore was set using the from address. This led
	  messages to be identified as junk by SPF, and bounces to be sent
	  back to the user. This is a fix that puts the correct envelope
	  sender back.	Since acs_mail_lite::send now accepts a multiple TO
	  address, the user_id part of the bounce address it set to 0 if
	  there are multiple recipients.

	* packages/acs-mail-lite/tcl/utils-procs.tcl: fix bug, where months
	  higher equal 08 lead to problems due to octal interpretation
	  (can't use invalid octal number as operand...), aborting
	  immediate mail sends in aug. or later.
